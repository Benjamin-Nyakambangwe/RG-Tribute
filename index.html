      <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
      <p>Robert Gabriel Mugabe, (21 February 1924 – 6 September 2019) was a Zimbabwean revolutionary and politician who served as Prime Minister of Zimbabwe from 1980 to 1987 and then as President from 1987 to 2017. He chaired the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) group from 1975 to 1980 and led its successor political party, the ZANU – Patriotic Front (ZANU–PF), from 1980 to 2017. Ideologically an African nationalist, during the 1970s and 1980s he identified as a Marxist–Leninist. He identified as a socialist after the 1990s. His policies have been described as Mugabeism. </p>

      <h2>TIMELINE</h2>
      <h4>1960 - 63:</h4>
      <p>While Mugabe was teaching abroad, an anti-colonialist African nationalist movement was established in Southern Rhodesia. It was first led by Joshua Nkomo's Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, founded in September 1957 and then banned by the colonial government in February 1959. SRANC was replaced by the more radically oriented National Democratic Party (NDP), founded in January 1960. In May 1960, Mugabe returned to Southern Rhodesia, bringing Hayfron with him. The pair had planned for their visit to be short, however Mugabe's friend, the African nationalist Leopold Takawira, urged them to stay.</p>
      <h4>1963 - 75:</h4>
      <p>Mugabe was arrested on his return to Southern Rhodesia in December 1963. His trial lasted from January to March 1964, during which he refused to retract the subversive statements that he had publicly made. In March 1964 he was sentenced to 21 months imprisonment. Mugabe was first imprisoned at Salisbury Maximum Security Prison, before being moved to the Wha Wha detention centre and then the Sikombela detention centre in Que Que. At the latter, he organised study classes for the inmates, teaching them basic literacy, maths, and English. Sympathetic black warders smuggled messages from Mugabe and other members of the ZANU executive committee to activists outside the prison. At the executive's bidding, ZANU activist Herbert Chitepo had organised a small guerrilla force in Lusaka. In April 1966 it carried out a failed attempt to destroy power pylons at Sinoia, and shortly after attacked a white-owned farm near Hartley, killing its inhabitants.[ The government responded by returning the members of the ZANU executive, including Mugabe, to Salisbury Prison in 1966. There, forty prisoners were divided among four communal cells, with many sleeping on the concrete floor due to overcrowding; Mugabe shared his cell with Sithole, Enos Nkala, and Edgar Tekere. He remained there for eight years, devoting his time to reading and studying. During this period he gained several further degrees from the University of London: a masters in economics, a bachelor of administration, and two law degrees.</p>
      <h4>1975 - 79:</h4>
      <p>In March 1975, Mugabe resolved to leave Rhodesia for Mozambique, ambitious to take control of ZANU's guerrilla campaign.[109] After his friend Maurice Nyagumbo was arrested, he feared the same fate but was hidden from the authorities by Ribeiro. Ribeiro and a sympathetic nun then assisted him and Edgar Tekere in smuggling themselves into Mozambique. Mugabe remained in exile there for two years. Mozambique's Marxist President Samora Machel was sceptical of Mugabe's leadership abilities and was unsure whether to recognise him as ZANU's legitimate leader. Machel gave him a house in Quelimane and kept him under partial house arrest, with Mugabe requiring permission to travel. It would be almost a year before Machel accepted Mugabe's leadership of ZANU.</p>
      <h4>1980:</h4>
      <p>Returning to Salisbury in January 1980, Mugabe was greeted by a supportive crowd.[149] He settled into a house in Mount Pleasant, a wealthy white-dominated suburb.[150] Machel had cautioned Mugabe not to alienate Rhodesia's white minority, warning him that any white flight after the election would cause economic damage as it had in Mozambique.[151] Accordingly, during his electoral campaign Mugabe avoided the use of Marxist and revolutionary rhetoric.[152] Mugabe insisted that in the election, ZANU would stand as a separate party to ZAPU, and refused Nkomo's request for a meeting.[153] He formed ZANU into a political party, known as Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF).[154] Predictions were made that ZANU-PF would win the election on the basis of the country's ethnic divisions; Mugabe was Shona, a community that made up around 70% of the country's population, while Nkomo was Ndebele, a tribal group who made up only around 20%.[155] For many in the white community and in the British government, this outcome was a terrifying prospect due to Mugabe's avowed Marxist beliefs and the inflammatory comments that he had made about whites during the guerrilla war.</p>
      <h4>1980 - 87</h4>
      <p>Mugabe took his oath of office on 17 April 1980.[166] He gave a speech at Salisbury's Rufaro Stadium announcing that Rhodesia would be renamed "Zimbabwe" and pledged racial reconciliation.[167] Soames aided Mugabe in bringing about an orderly transition of power; for this Mugabe remained grateful, describing Soames as a good friend.[168] Mugabe unsuccessfully urged Soames to remain in Zimbabwe for several more years,[169] and also failed to convince the UK to assume a two-year "guiding role" for his government because most ZANU-PF members lacked experience in governing.[170] ZANU-PF's absolute parliamentary majority allowed them to rule alone, but Mugabe created a government of national unity by inviting members of rival parties to join his cabinet.[171] Mugabe moved into the Premier's residence in Salisbury, which he left furnished in the same style as Smith had left it.[172]</p>
      <h4>RACE RELATIONS</h4>
      <p>Mugabe initially emphasised racial reconciliation and he was keen to build a good relationship with white Zimbabweans.[192] He hoped to avoid a white exodus and tried to allay fears that he would nationalise white-owned property.[193] He appointed two white ministers—David Smith and Denis Norman—to his government,[194] met with white leaders in agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce,[195] and impressed senior figures in the outgoing administration like Smith and Ken Flower with his apparent sincerity.[196] With the end of the war, petrol rationing, and economic sanctions, life for white Zimbabweans improved during the early years of Mugabe's rule.[197] In the economic boom that followed, the white minority—which controlled considerable property and dominated commerce, industry, and banking—were the country's main beneficiaries.[177]</p>
      <h4>RELATIONS WITH ZAPU AND GUKURAHUNDI</h4>
      <P>Under the new constitution, Zimbabwe's Presidency was a ceremonial role with no governmental power; the first President was Canaan Banana.[212] Mugabe had previously offered the position to Nkomo, who had turned it down in favour of becoming Minister of Home Affairs.[213] While working together, there remained an aura of resentment and suspicion between Mugabe and Nkomo.[214] Mugabe gave ZAPU four cabinet seats, but Nkomo demanded more.[215] In contrast, some ZANU-PF figures argued that ZAPU should not have any seats in government, suggesting that Zimbabwe be converted into a one-party state.[216] Tekere and Enos Nkala were particularly adamant that there should be a crackdown on ZAPU.[216] After Nkala called for ZAPU to be violently crushed during a rally in Entumbane, street clashes between the two parties broke out in the city.[217</P>
      <h4>1987 - 95</h4>
      <p>In late 1987, Zimbabwe's parliament amended the constitution.[246] On 30 December it declared Mugabe to be executive President, a new position that combined the roles of head of state, head of government, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.[247] This position gave him the power to dissolve parliament, declare martial law, and run for an unlimited number of terms.[248] According to his biographer Martin Meredith, Mugabe now had "a virtual stranglehold on government machinery and unlimited opportunities to exercise patronage".[248] The constitutional amendments also abolished the twenty parliamentary seats reserved for white representatives,[249] and left parliament less relevant and independent.[2</p>
      <h4>1995 - 2000</h4>
      <p>Over the course of the 1990s, Zimbabwe's economy steadily deteriorated.[276] By 2000, living standards had declined from 1980; life expectancy was reduced, average wages were lower, and unemployment had trebled.[277] By 1998, unemployment was almost at 50%.[276] As of 2009, three to four million Zimbabweans—the greater part of the nation's skilled workforce—had left the country.[278] In 1997 there were growing demands for pensions from those who had fought for the guerrilla armies in the revolutionary war, and in August 1997 Mugabe put together a pension package that would cost the county ZD 4.2 billion.[279] To finance this pension scheme, Mugabe's government proposed new taxes, but a general strike was called in protest in December 1997; amid protest from ZANU-PF itself, Mugabe's government abandoned the taxes.[280] In January 1998, riots about lack of access to food broke out in Harare; the army was deployed to restore order, with at least ten killed and hundreds injured.[28</p>
      <h4>2000 - 08</h4>
      <p>The June 2000 parliamentary elections were Zimbabwe's most important since 1980.[307] Sixteen parties took part, and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC)—led by trade unionist Morgan Tsvangirai—was particularly successful.[307] During the election campaign, MDC activists were regularly harassed and in some cases killed.[308] The Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum documented 27 murders, 27 rapes, 2466 assaults, and 617 abductions, with 10,000 people displaced by violence; the majority, but not all, of these actions were carried out by ZANU-PF supporters.[309] Observers from the European Union (EU) ruled that the election was neither free nor fair.[310] The vote produced 48% and 62 parliamentary seats for ZANU-PF and 47% and 57 parliamentary seats for the MDC.[311] For the first time, ZANU-PF were denied the two-thirds parliamentary majority required to push through constitutional change.[307] ZANU-PF had relied heavily on their support base in rural Shona-speaking areas, and retained only one urban constituency.[312]</p>
      <h4>2008 -13</h4>
      <p>In March 2008, the parliamentary and presidential elections were held. In the former, ZANU-PF secured 97 seats to the MDC's 99 and the rival MDC – Ncube's 9.[356][357] In May, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission announced the presidential vote results, confirming that Tsvangirai secured 47.9%, to Mugabe's 43.2%. As neither candidate secured 50%, a run-off vote was scheduled.[358] Mugabe saw his defeat as an unacceptable personal humiliation.[359] He deemed it a victory for his Western, and in particular British, detractors, whom he believed were working with Tsvangirai to end his political career.[359] ZANU-PF claimed that the MDC had rigged the election. After the election, Mugabe's government deployed its 'war veterans' in a violent campaign against Tsvangirai supporters.[361] Between March and June 2008, at least 153 MDC supporters were killed.[362] There were reports of women affiliated with the MDC being subjected to gang rape by Mugabe supporters.[362] Tens of thousands of Zimbabweans were internally displaced by the violence.[362] These actions brought international condemnation of Mugabe's government. </p>
      <h4>2017: Coup d'etat And REsignation</h4>
      <p>On 6 November 2017, Mugabe sacked his first vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa. This fuelled speculation that he intended to name Grace his successor. Grace was very unpopular with the ZANU-PF old guard. On 15 November 2017, the Zimbabwe National Army placed Mugabe under house arrest as part of what it described as an action against "criminals" in Mugabe's circle.[396][397][398]On 19 November, he was sacked as leader of ZANU-PF, and Mnangagwa was appointed in his place.[399] The party also gave Mugabe an ultimatum: resign by noon the following day, or it would introduce an impeachment resolution against him. In a nationally televised speech that night, Mugabe refused to say that he would resign.[400] In response, ZANU-PF deputies introduced an impeachment resolution on 21 November 2017, which was seconded by the MDC-T.[401] The constitution stipulated that removing a president from office required a two-thirds majority of both the House of Assembly and Senate in a joint sitting. However, with both major parties supporting the motion, Mugabe's impeachment and removal appeared all but certain. </p>
      <h4>POST PRESIDENCY</h4>
      <P>Late in December 2017, according to a government gazette, Mugabe was given full diplomatic status and, out of public funds, a five-bedroom house, up to 23 staff members, and personal vehicles. He further was permitted to keep the business interests and other wealth which he had amassed while in power, and he received an additional payment of about ten million dollars.[406]On 15 March 2018, in his first interview since removal from the presidency, Mugabe insisted that he had been ousted in a "coup d'état" which must be undone. He stated that he would not work with Mnangagwa and termed Mnangagwa's presidency "illegal" and "unconstitutional".[407] In a lawsuit brought by two political parties, the Liberal Democrats and the Revolutionary Freedom Fighters, and others, the court found that the resignation was legal, and that Mnangagwa, as vice president, duly took over the presidency.[405]On the eve of the first general election without him in almost thirty years, on 29 July 2018, Mugabe held a surprise press conference, in which he stated that he would not vote for President Mnangagwa and ZANU-PF, the party he founded. Instead, he intended to vote for his long-time rival, the MDC party of Nelson Chamisa.[408][409][410][411] </P>
      <h4>ILLNESS AND DEATH</h4>
      <P>Mugabe was hospitalized in April 2019, making the last of several trips to Singapore for medical treatment, as he had done late in his presidency and in the months following its end.[412][413] He died on 6 September 2019, at the age of 95, at Gleneagles Hospital in Singapore, at about 10:40 am, according to a senior Zimbabwean diplomat. The Singaporean Ministry of Foreign Affairs is working with the Zimbabwean embassy the arrangements for the late his body to be flown back to Zimbabwe.</P>
